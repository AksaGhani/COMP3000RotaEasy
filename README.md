## About the Project 

### Project Vision 
<p>RotaEasy is to be developed for managerial positions within a business or store predominantly within the supermarket industry.  The aim of the software is to reduce time utilized for scheduling staff in for their contracted hours within a supermarket / convenience store, by a means of using Artificial Intelligence to identify an optimum schedule and/or generating timetables with a click of a button. Unlike most alternative software for timetabling within industry, RotaEasy comes with two different access points. A desktop application primarily for managers, and a mobile application to allow easy access for employees / staff within the store to view their shift timings. Not only this, but the product differentiates by implementing a feature to allow employees to swap shifts with other employees with ease and in a safe environment, reducing complications which otherwise could be caused without proper containment of the timetable.</p>
